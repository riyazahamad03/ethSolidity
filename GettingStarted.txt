solc version installation:
 npm install solc@0.4.17


installation of some modules:
testing framework:
	npm install mocha ganache-cli
web3 version:
	npm install mocha ganache-cli web3






mocha function:
	run a test and make assertion --- 'it'
	group collection of 'it' function ---- 'describe'
	some general code setup --- 'beforeEach'

implementation of mocha :
	change the script tag in package.json to 'mocha' 
	then  execute the following command 'npm run test'



deployment to public network:
	previously we used ganache as an provider so no need to worry of the accounts because ganache provides accounts with unlocked mnemonic
	now, to deploy to local network we need to provide the account 
	so that we use rinkeby test network for developmen of this project.. this takes very much time 
	so infura api service helps to access to node on rinkeby network
	please note that rinkeby is no longer exist we use gorli network instead
implementation process:
	create an new file deploy.js in same hierarchy of compile.js 
	npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider
	command to run "node deploy.js"
